# Changelog

## [0.2.2] - 2025-11-03

### Fixed
- Tibber current price now correctly read from sensor state
- Tibber price level correctly read from German level sensor
- Average price calculation from Tibber attributes working
- PV forecast tomorrow now displays correctly (sum of both roofs)

### Changed
- Simplified Tibber price reading logic (removed complex timezone parsing)
- Controller now supports both German and English price levels
- Added automatic dark/light mode detection
- Light mode is now the default for better readability

### UI
- Automatic dark mode activation when system prefers dark color scheme
- Better contrast in both light and dark mode
- Improved overall readability

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-03

### Changed
- Update interval reduced from 10s to 2s for more responsive UI
- Improved Tibber price parsing to correctly show current price from hourly price array
- Added support for dual-roof PV systems (separate sensors for each roof orientation)
- PV forecast now sums production from both roof orientations
- Price level strings now use English format (CHEAP, EXPENSIVE, etc.)

### Removed
- SOC synchronization feature removed (min/max SOC should be configured directly in inverter)
- Removed `/api/sync_soc` endpoint
- Removed `set_battery_soc_limits()` method from kostal_api
- Removed SOC sync button from dashboard

### Fixed
- Current electricity price now correctly displayed from Tibber sensor attributes
- PV forecast calculation for systems with multiple roof orientations
- Timezone handling for Tibber price matching

### Technical
- Added `get_state_with_attributes()` method to ha_client for full entity data retrieval
- New PV sensor configuration: `pv_power_now_roof1/2`, `pv_remaining_today_roof1/2`, etc.
- Removed legacy `pv_forecast_sensor` and `consumption_sensor` options
